#  Translate a Language

### [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Udacity

### **Project 4**

In this project we have to train a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French. The project was writen in Python (on a [_Jupyter Notebook_](https://github.com/HaraldoFilho/DLND-language-translation/blob/master/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb)) using the libraries _numpy_ and _tensorflow_, running on an _Anaconda_ environment.

#### Topics covered

- Sequence to Sequence RNNs
