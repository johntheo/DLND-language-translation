#  Translate a Language

### [_**Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation**_](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) from Udacity

### **Project 4**

In this project we had to build a [Sequence to Sequence model](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq) that can translate new sentences from English to French and train it on a dataset of English and French sentences. The project was written in Python (on a [_Jupyter Notebook_](https://github.com/HaraldoFilho/DLND-language-translation/blob/master/dlnd_language_translation.ipynb)) using the libraries _numpy_ and _tensorflow_, running on an _Anaconda_ environment.
